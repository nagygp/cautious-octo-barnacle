# Dobbertin (1999), pp. 133–138 — a faithful skeleton transcription

**Status (this pass).**  The proofs of the transcribed statements are now filled
in, reusing the library's finite-field machinery (`TraceFreeCriterion`, `TraceVersionInfra`,
`TraceVersionBase`, and the new parity-general `q₁` criterion in
`Headlines.TraceVersionCriterion`).  A few of the *internal* skeleton statements had to be
minimally corrected to be provable — this is documented at each such statement:

* `eqn2_of_eqn1` — the original is *false* as stated (it holds at `x = 0`, where
  `ℓ(0) = 1 ≠ 0`, while the cleared equation `eqn1` is satisfied vacuously).  The
  faithful version adds `x ≠ 0` and the field hypotheses `hn`, `k·k' ≡ 1 (mod n)`.
* `qKasami_bijective_iff_case2` — the original counts *all* solutions of the cleared equation
  `eqn1`, but `x = 0` always satisfies `eqn1` (both sides are `0`).  The faithful
  version counts the **nonzero** solutions (as in the paper) and adds `c ≠ 0`.
* The permutation/APN statements carry the non-degeneracy hypothesis
  `2^k + 1 < 2^n - 1` (excluding only the marginal fields `𝔽₂`, `𝔽₄`), exactly as
  the library's `TraceFreeCriterion.qeps_bijective_iff` does, together with `0 < k`.

The original statements are kept (commented out) next to their corrected forms.

it transcribes the definitions of the generalized Kasami and MCM polynomials,

**Corollary 2**.

It began life as a *skeleton* (definitions stated as in the paper, every theorem or
proof-step left as `sorry`).  In this pass the proofs have been **filled in**
(see the Status note above): the transcribed statements are now proved, reusing
the library's finite-field machinery, and nothing that is not in these pages of the
paper is included as a *result* (only the bridges to the library are added).

## Abstract (Dobbertin 1999)

We study permutation polynomials on `𝔽_{2ⁿ}`, which are associated with Kasami
power functions `xᵈ`, i.e. `d = 2^{2k} − 2^k + 1` for `k < n` with `gcd(k, n) = 1`.
We describe the equivalence of a class of ("Kasami") permutation polynomials,
considered to derive the APN property of Kasami power functions, and the well-known
class of MCM permutation polynomials.  Explicit and recursive formulae for the
inverses of Kasami and MCM permutation polynomials are given.  As an application
the image `B` under the two-to-one mapping `(x+1)ᵈ + xᵈ + 1` can be characterized
by a trace condition, and the 2-rank of `B* = B ∖ {0}` can be determined.  We
conjecture that `B*` is a cyclic difference set.

## 1. Introduction

Janwa and Wilson (1993) seem to have been the first to prove, in a coding-theory
context, that Kasami power functions `xᵈ` are almost perfect nonlinear (APN) on
`L = 𝔽_{2ⁿ}`.  We call `xᵈ` a **Kasami power function** and `d` a **Kasami
exponent** if
```
   d = 2^{2k} − 2^k + 1,   where  k < n  and  gcd(k, n) = 1.
```
Recall (Nyberg 1994) that `xᵈ` is **APN** if for all `a ∈ L*`, `b ∈ L` the equation
`(x+a)ᵈ + xᵈ = b` has either no or precisely two solutions in `L`.

In Section 2 we state and verify (Theorem 1) which generalized Kasami polynomials
are permutation polynomials; this yields a short new proof that MCM polynomials are
permutations, and — via a two-to-one factorization — the APN property of Kasami
power functions (Corollary 2).

/-! ## Section 2 — the generalized Kasami and MCM polynomials

Throughout Section 2 we assume
```
   gcd(k, n) = 1,   k < n,   k' ≡ 1/k (mod n).
```
For `α = 0, 1` the paper defines the **generalized Kasami polynomial**
```
                 ( Σ_{i=1}^{k'} z^{2^{ik}} )  +  α·Tr(z)
   q_α(z)  =    ─────────────────────────────────────────
                              z^{2^k + 1}
```
and for `β = 0, 1` the **generalized MCM polynomial**
```
                 ( Σ_{i=0}^{k-1} z^{2^i}  +  β·Tr(z) )^{2^k + 1}
   P_β(z)  =    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
                              z^{2^k}
```
(the factors `1/z^{2^k+1}` and `1/z^{2^k}` being replaced by `z^{(2ⁿ−1)−(2^k+1)}`
and `z^{(2ⁿ−1)−2^k}` respectively to obtain genuine polynomials on `L`, with the
convention `0/0 = 0`).  Recall that `P₀` is an MCM permutation polynomial if `k`
is odd. -/

The generalized Kasami polynomial `qKasami` of this skeleton coincides, for the
two admissible values `α = 0, 1`, with the library polynomials `TraceFree.qeps`
(trace-free, `ε = 0`) and `TraceParityCase.gmap` (the trace version `q^{(Tr·)}`).  These
bridges let us reuse the library's permutation criteria. -/

/-! ## The elementary shortcut invariant `k' + alpha*n (mod 2)`

The value of `q_alpha` at `1` is the single number `k' + alpha*n (mod 2)`, and it
already decides the necessary direction of Theorem 1 with no finite-field
machinery: `q_alpha` fixes `0` (the `0/0 = 0` convention makes the numerator
vanish), and `q_alpha(1) = k' + alpha*n`; so if `k' + alpha*n` were even, then
`q_alpha` would identify `0` and `1` in the field.  This is the small structural
invariant that propagates from the Mathlib base straight to the headline, and
`qKasami_bijective_iff` below discharges its necessary half through it, reserving the heavy
engine (`TraceFreeCriterion`/`gmap_bijective_iff`) for the sufficient half only. -/

/-! ### Proof of Theorem 1 (the paper's argument)

First note that `(2^k − 1)⁻¹ (mod 2ⁿ−1)` exists, since `gcd(k, n) = 1`.  We have
`q_α(0) = 0`, using the convention `0/0 = 0`.

*Only if.*  `k' + α·n ≡ 0 (mod 2)` is equivalent to `q_α(1) = k'·1 + α·Tr(1) = 0`,
so `q_α` is not injective.

*If.*  Assume `k' + α·n ≡ 1 (mod 2)`.  We show that for each fixed `c ∈ L`, the
equation
```
   c·x^{2^k+1} = Σ_{i=1}^{k'} x^{2^{ik}} + α·Tr(x)                     (1)
```
(i.e. `q_α(x) = c`) has at most one solution.  Adding the `2^k`-th power of (1) to
itself gives
```
   ℓ(x) = c^{2^k}·x^{2^{2k}} + x^{2^k} + c·x + 1 = 0.                  (2)
```
Note that `ℓ(x) = 0` iff `c·x^{2^k+1} + Σ_{i=1}^{k'} x^{2^{ik}} + α·Tr(x) ∈ {0, 1}`.
`ℓ` has one, two or four roots in `L`; at most one of them solves (1). -/

/-- Equation (1): the equation `q_α(x) = c` cleared of denominators,
`c·x^{2^k+1} = Σ_{i=1}^{k'} x^{2^{ik}} + α·Tr(x)`. -/
def eqn1 (n k k' : ℕ) (α : ℕ) (c x : L) : Prop :=
  c * x ^ (2 ^ k + 1) = (∑ i ∈ Finset.Icc 1 k', x ^ (2 ^ (i * k))) + (α : L) * Tr n x

/-- The linearized polynomial `ℓ(x) = c^{2^k}·x^{2^{2k}} + x^{2^k} + c·x + 1` of

def ell (k : ℕ) (c x : L) : L :=
  c ^ (2 ^ k) * x ^ (2 ^ (2 * k)) + x ^ (2 ^ k) + c * x + 1

/-
Equation (2) is derived from equation (1) by adding its `2^k`-th power.

**Correction.**  The original skeleton statement (kept commented out below) is
*false*: at `x = 0` the cleared equation `eqn1` holds vacuously (`0 = 0`), yet
`ℓ(0) = 1 ≠ 0`.  The faithful version adds `x ≠ 0` and the field hypotheses
`hn` and `k·k' ≡ 1 (mod n)` (used by the Artin–Schreier telescoping).

/-! #### Case 2: `c = γ^{2^k+1} + γ` for some `γ ∈ L`

Setting `Q(x) = c·x^{2^k} + γ²·x + γ` and `f = γ^{2^k−1} + 1/γ` we have
`ℓ(x) = Q(x)^{2^k} + f·Q(x)`, and therefore `ℓ(x) = 0` iff `Q(x) = 0` or
`Q(x) = 1/f^{2^k−1}`.  Introduce auxiliary quantities `λ, Δ, μ` (equations (3)–(5))
so that certain relations (6)–(7) hold.  One shows that precisely one of the two
solutions of `Q(x) = 1/f^{2^k−1}` and none of the solutions of `Q(x) = 0` solves
(1).  For the two roots `x₀, x₁` of `Q(x) = 1/Δ` (with `x₀ + x₁ = Δ`,
`Tr(Δ) = 0`), setting `εⱼ = c·xⱼ^{2^k+1} + Σ_{i=1}^{k'} xⱼ^{2^{ik}} + α·Tr(xⱼ)`
one computes `ε₀ + ε₁ = 1`, hence exactly one `xⱼ` solves (1).  For a root `z` of
`Q(x) = 0` one computes
`c·z^{2^k+1} + Σ_{i=1}^{k'} z^{2^{ik}} + α·Tr(z) = k' + α·n ≡ 1 (mod 2)`, so `z`

**Theorem 1, Case 2.**  If `c = γ^{2^k+1} + γ` (with `c ≠ 0`), then exactly one
**nonzero** `x` solves equation (1).

**Correction.**  The original skeleton statement (kept commented out below)
counted *all* solutions of the cleared equation `eqn1`; but `x = 0` always
satisfies `eqn1` (both sides are `0`), so that count is never `1` when a genuine
(nonzero) solution exists.  The paper's claim — "exactly one of the roots solves
(1)" — is faithfully the count of **nonzero** solutions, which needs `c ≠ 0`
(equivalently `γ ≠ 1`, since `γ = 1` gives `c = 0`).

/-! ## Corollary 2

> **Corollary 2.** Kasami power functions are almost perfect nonlinear.

*Proof.*  If `k' ≡ 1/k (mod n)` is odd, set `q = q₀`; otherwise set `q = q₁`
(if `k'` is even then `n` must be odd, since `k'` and `n` are relatively prime).
By Theorem 1, `q` is a permutation polynomial.  A routine computation shows that
for `p(t) = (t+1)ᵈ + tᵈ + 1` we have `p(t) = 1/q(t^{2^k} + t)`.  On the other hand
`t ↦ t^{2^k} + t` maps two-to-one, since `gcd(k, n) = 1`.  ∎ -/

The Kasami derivative `p(t) = (t+1)ᵈ + tᵈ + 1` is two-to-one on `L = 𝔽_{2ⁿ}`.

This is the heart of Corollary 2: choosing `α` so that `q_α` is a permutation
(possible since `k'` and `n` are not both even), the routine computation
`p(t)·q_α(t^{2^k}+t) = 1` (for `t ∉ 𝔽₂`) writes `p = (·)⁻¹ ∘ q_α ∘ (t ↦ t^{2^k}+t)`.
Since `t ↦ t^{2^k}+t` is two-to-one (`frob_shift_two_to_one`), `q_α` is a
bijection, and `(·)⁻¹` is injective on units, every fibre of `p` has exactly two
elements (the fibre over `0` being `{0, 1}`).
